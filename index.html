It encapsulates natural environments, landscapes, ecosystems, weather patterns, and the intricate interplay between living entities and their surroundings. Beyond the tangible world, "nature" also conveys inherent qualities or characteristics, whether in reference to human behavior, the essential properties of substances, or broader philosophical concepts. Often juxtaposed with human-made elements, nature emphasizes the organic, non-human, and pristine aspects of the world. Conservation, ecology, and environmentalism discussions frequently center around the imperative to preserve nature, safeguarding biodiversity and the delicate balance of natural systems.
